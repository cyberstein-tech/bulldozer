<h2>BulldozerPIXI by George J. Moo at Cyberstein Technologies</h1>
<h4>What the hell is this? </h4>
<p>BulldozerPIXI is a recreation of the original Bulldozer game series created by John 'FlyMan' Hattan (The Code Zone) for Windows 95. The aim of this project was to make my childhood favourite, playable on a modern web browser and even on mobile devices. </p>
<h4>How to play?</h4>
<p>This is a puzzle game where the objective is to push the boulders onto the bullseye targets without getting them stuck on the tilemap. While the game concept is simple, some advanced map levels can be incredibly challenging. BulldozerPIXI is best played on a desktop or laptop but can be played on modern smartphones with a large enough browser viewport. You can move the bulldozer character up(W or Up-Arrow keys), down(S or Down-Arrow keys), left(A or Left-Arrow keys) or right(D or Right-Arrow keys). If playing on a mobile device, you are limited to the onscreen arrow-key buttons.<p>

<li>Be careful with pushing boulders against the wall. The boulder might become "stuck" and you might have to restart the level.</li>

<h4>Credits</h4>
<p> Tilemap graphics, map data and inspiration were shamelessly taken from the <a href="https://github.com/westoncampbell/BulldozerAHK">BulldozerAHK project</a> by Weston Campbell. If you want a real clone of the original game with the additional bells and whistles, I would advise you to check out his awesome work.</p>
